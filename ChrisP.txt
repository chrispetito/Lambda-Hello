Hello! My name is Chris Petito.

I am a collaborative, hard-working, and creative person.
If I had to name a favorite animal, it would be the eagle.
My favorite hobbies include spending time with family and friends, going to the movies, and finding and listening to new music.
I am a full-time full stack web dev student at Lambda, and I am excited for the future!
